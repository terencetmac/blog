# My Static Blog

- work in progress

## Goals
My previous blog was Ghost and I liked writing in Markdown with a live preview by the side. Recently I've spent time
writing documentation at work in Markdown and have embraced its simplicity and abstraction away from thinking about
formatting. I found that I no longer needed a live preview as I got used to seeing Markdown syntax in the file.

At the same time, Ghost requires regular updating and I've generally been too lazy to do that. I also recently started
down the rabbit hole that is Vim and thought it'll be interesting to do more writing in Vim to practice. I wanted a
simple blogging solution, writing posts in Markdown and hosting it in Git.
